# EasyJump.vim

Jump to any location on screen by typing two characters.

## TL;DR

- `s` + _\<character>_ + _\<tag_character>_ to jump
- `ds` + _\<character>_ + _\<tag_character>_ to delete (similarly, `vs` for visual selection, `cs` for change, etc.)
- `<Tab>` and `<S-Tab>` (or `;` and `,`) after _\<character>_ to view additional tag characters
- `2s` + _\<character_1>_ + _\<character_2>_ + _\<tag_character>_ to jump _(new)_

## Features

- Initially bound to `s`, but it can be reassigned to any desired trigger (e.g., `,`).
- Supports essential Vim idioms such as `ds` for deletion, `cs` for change, `vs` for visual selection, and more. Here `s` is the trigger character.
- Updates the jump list (`:jumps`) for easy back-navigation using `<c-o>`.
- Optional two-character mode, for users accustomed to targeting with two characters instead of one.
- Non-disruptive: Does not modify the buffer. Crafted in vim9 script.


ðŸš€ **Jump (`s`)**: Type `s` followed by a character (say `c`). Witness
new tag characters replacing the character `c`. Typing next
character initiates the jump. For instance, typing `e`
navigates the cursor to the `c` under `e`.

ðŸš€ **Jump back**: Type `<c-o>` (control-O) to jump back. Type `<tab>` or `<c-i>` to jump forward.

ðŸš€ **Visual Select (`vs`)**: For visually selecting a block of text from the
cursor position up to an instance of `c`, enter `vsc`, then the highlighted
character (e.g., `e`).

Likewise, use `ds` for deletion or `cs` for text alteration.

Press `<esc>` to cancel the ongoing jump.

Pictures above are based on `:colorscheme quiet`.

ðŸ”Ž **What if the intended jump location is not showing a tag letter?**

This scenario occurs when there aren't enough unique letters available for
tagging. Simply press `<Tab>` (or `;`), and new tag labels will fill the
remaining spots. To cycle backwards, press `<S-Tab>` (or `,`).

ðŸš€ **Two-Character Mode (New)**: Activated with `2s` or simply `s` if `g:easyjump_two_chars` is configured as `true`.

- Use `2s` + _\<character>_ + _\<tag_character>_ to leap to your destination (when a tag character marks the spot).
- If no tag label is present, type the adjacent character as well, forming `2s` + _\<character_1>_ + _\<character_2>_ + _\<tag_character>_ to execute the jump.

> [!TIP]
> A lazy way to navigate is by leveraging the space character as a guide. Experiment with typing `s` followed by `<space>`. The algorithm strives to allocate one label per line. Once you're near your desired location within a line, you can [effectively employ](https://github.com/girishji/fFtT.vim) Vim's built-in `f/F, t/T` commands to reach it precisely. This is an alternative to using relative line numbers to jump.

# Requirements

- Vim version 9.0 or higher

# Installation

Install using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). Add the following lines to your `.vimrc` file:

```
vim9script
plug#begin()
Plug 'girishji/easyjump.vim'
plug#end()
```

For legacy scripts, use:

```
call plug#begin()
Plug 'girishji/easyjump.vim'
call plug#end()
```

Alternatively, utilize Vim's built-in package manager.

# Configuration

## Trigger Key

By default, `s` serves as the trigger key. To unmap `s` and restore it to the default (:h s),
include the following line in your .vimrc file:

```
g:easyjump_default_keymap = false
```

To assign `,` as the trigger for jumping, add the following lines to your `.vimrc`
file. You can choose any other key beside `,`.

```
nmap , <Plug>EasyjumpJump;
omap , <Plug>EasyjumpJump;
vmap , <Plug>EasyjumpJump;
```

## Case Sensitivity

Options include 'case' (case sensitive), 'icase' (ignore case), or 'smart'
(smart case). Add the following line to your .vimrc:

```
g:easyjump_case = 'smart' # Can be 'case', 'icase', or 'smart' (default).
```

## Highlight Group

The tag letters displayed alongside destination locations utilize the
highlighted group `EasyJump`. By default, this group is linked to `IncSearch`. Modify its
appearance using the `:highlight` command to change colors.

## Tag Letters

Jump locations prioritize placement based on distance from cursor and
preference for having at least one placement per line.
Letters are picked in the following sequence. Modify the sequence (say, for
Dvorak) as needed. Set the following global variable:

```
g:easyjump_letters = 'asdfgwercvhjkluiopynmbtqxzASDFGWERCVHJKLUIOPYNMBTQXZ0123456789'
```
