# EasyJump.vim

Jump to any location by typing 2 characters.

- Mapped to `,` but any other trigger (like `s`) can be configured.
- Vim idioms supported. Use `d,xy` to delete, `c,xy` to change, `v,xy` to select visually, etc.
- Jump list (`:jumps`) updated so that you can jump back using `<c-o>`.
- Does not alter the buffer. Uses virtual text. Written in vim9 script.
- Does not block the character you are trying to jump to.

ðŸš€ **Jump (ex. `,cd`)**: Type `,` and `c` (say) and you'll see new letters (virtual text) appear next to all the occurrences of `c`. Type `d` (for instance) and cursor jumps to `c` next to `d`.

ðŸš€ **Jump back**: Type `<c-o>` (control-O). Jump forward with `<tab>` or `<c-i>'.

ðŸš€ **Visual Select (ex. `v,cd`)**: To visually select a block of text starting
from cursor position to some occurrence of `c` type `v,c` and then type the
highlighted character (say `d`).

ðŸš€ **Operator Pending**: `d,xy` to delete, `c,xy` to change text.

Type `<esc>` to **cancel** the jump.

Above illustrations use `:colorscheme quiet`.

**What if there is no letter next to where you want to jump to?**

This happens when there are not enough available unique letters. Simply type
`<Tab>` (or `,` again, or `;`) and you'll see letters appear in remaining
locations. This should be rare.

**Motivation:** For a long time I have used relative numbers with `j`/`k` along
with `f`/`t` commands to jump. But I always found it distracting to shift focus to the left to
look up the line number. This plugin helps you keep your eyes on the
target you want to jump to. I think this is the missing motion of
Vim. I still use `f` and `t` when seeking within the same line since it is the most
efficient.

# Requirements

- Vim >= 9.0

# Installation

Install using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). Put the following in `.vimrc` file.

```
vim9script
plug#begin()
Plug 'girishji/easyjump.vim'
plug#end()
```

Legacy script:

```
call plug#begin()
Plug 'girishji/easyjump.vim'
call plug#end()
```

Or use Vim's builtin package manager.

# Configuration

### Trigger Key

Default trigger key is `,`. To change this to `s` (for example) put the following in `.vimrc` file.

```
vim9script
g:easyjump_default_keymap = false
nmap s <Plug>EasyjumpJump;
omap s <Plug>EasyjumpJump;
vmap s <Plug>EasyjumpJump;
```

### Case

The destination character you type is compared against visible buffer text. To make the search case sensitive (case), insensitive (icase), or smart case (smart) put the following in `.vimrc`.

```
g:easyjump_case = 'smart' # Can be 'case', 'icase', or 'smart' (default).
```

### Highlight

The virtual text that appears next to destination locations uses highlighted group `EasyJump`. It is linked to `MatchParen` by default. Set this group using `:highlight` command to change colors.

### Letters

The virtual text letters that appear next to the destination you want to jump to are prioritized based on distance from the cursor, with at least one letter per line. The letters appear in the following order of decreasing priority. The letters and order can be changed by assigning to the following variable.

```
g:easyjump_letters = 'asdfgwercvhjkluiopynmbtqxzASDFGWERCVHJKLUIOPYNMBTQXZ0123456789'
```
